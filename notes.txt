1. Lowgular handles routing, but has problems with imports when creating page or when adding routing to a routing module
    It has the names of what to import, but just does import it
    + the error for tsconfig.json still occurs

2. Problems with importing Angular-related stuff like @Component and @NgModule when creating a component with Lowgular
  It creates the files, with correct spelling, etc. but does not actually import anything
  If you have an extensions for imports you might be OK, but importing manually every time is annoying

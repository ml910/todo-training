1. Lowgular handles routing, but has problems with imports when creating page or when adding routing to a routing module
    It has the names of what to import, but just does import it
    + the error for tsconfig.json still occurs

2. Problems with importing Angular-related stuff like @Component and @NgModule when creating a component with Lowgular
  It creates the files, with correct spelling, etc. but does not actually import anything
  If you have an extensions for imports you might be OK, but importing manually every time is annoying

3. Adding and connecting pages is intuitive and friendly, no problems with subpages

4. Just noticed it now - components are created without testing spec files,
  but we do have the 'Debug Jest', 'Run Jest' and 'Watch Jest' options available
  What happened to tests?
  Do I need to create components in some different way to get pre-processed spec files generated?

5. There is no functionality for ActivatedRoute interactions in Lowgular that I could find,
  and the instructional videos also do not show such functionality - this would be super important to add I think
  Nice that that the video does show to not use snapshot, though

6. Git stash does not revert creating pages

7. When explaining ActivatedRoute and dynamic params it would be cool to extend the task with click event
    with redirection to specific page of an employee
    It would be super useful to show redirection to specific employee on click inside the employees list

8. Default Bootstrap hamburger from the copy-paste code example on their webpage is broken;
  this has been the case since 4.1.x, and they still have not fixed it
